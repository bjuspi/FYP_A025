## Abstract
SLAM, formally known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, has been gaining a lot of attention recently because it is now feasible to traverse in an unknown environment without any human operator. The improvements in exploring an unknown environment, responding to unforeseen variables, and the ability to run autonomously give autonomous mobile robots great advantages over conventional industrial robots. However, the prevailing issues with SLAM are the limited amount of time in real-world applications and the degree of accuracy. The aim of this project is to research and design an indoor navigation SLAM system which allows robots to localize and navigate around stairs. This project also aims to study the suitable object detection model in use with the SLAM system. The object detection model needs to have a balance between inference speed and accuracy of prediction. Therefore, further studies are needed to optimize the object detection model for the SLAM system.

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a SLAM system for stair-climbing robots operating in narrow spaces. The system aims to enhance autonomous navigation and localization capabilities, addressing challenges in accuracy and time constraints.

## Methodology
The research involves designing an indoor navigation SLAM system and studying object detection models that balance inference speed and accuracy. The goal is to optimize these models for effective integration with the SLAM system.

## Results
The project is expected to improve the robot's ability to autonomously navigate stairs, with optimized object detection models enhancing SLAM performance.

## Conclusion
Further studies are required to refine the object detection models and fully integrate them with the SLAM system, ensuring efficient and accurate navigation.
